Welcome to the official repository for Logicortex, an autonomous application security platform designed to find and fix complex business logic vulnerabilities.

## üìú About The Project


Logicortex operates as an active, intelligent partner within the software development lifecycle. Instead of just matching known bad patterns, it uses a team of specialized AI agents to understand the intended behavior of an application's code and then identify, fix, and even predict any actions that would violate that intent.
