1. If I scan a repository once, and I want to run the analysis again, I shouldn't need to have to send it all to the LLM again and waste tokens. If there's a way to track the changes since the last scan WHILE preserving context, it needs to be implemented. 

2. What if companies have no conflicts in their codebase? Do we need to be more strict with our heuristics checking? It's better to be a little strict rather than missing something.
